### Building RAG pipelines with LangChain

The initial pipeline involved loading my CV, chunking it, embedding it, and storing it in a VectorDB. This was followed by using retrieval techniques and incorporating chat memory to create a chatbot on CV. This is a small example but used to understand the concepts before trying larger pipelines.

Next Steps:
- Larger Documents for pipeline (Databases, powerpoints, my own movie reviews - LetterBoxed API) <br>
- Create frontend to display the chat <br>
- Build own retriver class (Using SelfQuery) <br>
