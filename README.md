### Building RAG pipelines with LangChain

Inital pipeline consisted of using my CV, loading, chunking and storing as a VectorDB. Then using retreval techniques and eventually adding in chat memory to create a chatbot about my CV.

Next Steps:
- Larger Documents for pipeline (Databases, powerpoints) <br>
- Create frontend to display the chat <br>
- Build own retriver class (Using SelfQuery) <br>
